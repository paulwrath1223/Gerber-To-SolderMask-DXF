## What does it do?
It takes a gerber file* and returns a dxf file*
## Why the asterisks?
I tested this on fusion 360 (2024?) and while it can take an exported layer from Fusion and make a valid DXF file, Fusion refuses to read it properly. converting to dwg online and then opening it makes it work right. (although that process seems to change the scale by a factor of 10)

## Basically it works on my machine, email me if you really want to work on this, but I got what I needed out of it
There are dirty tricks everywhere because Gerber is the worst. Basically G-Code but at home.
